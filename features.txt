Feature 1: Friends-Only Leaderboard
Description:
The Friends-Only Leaderboard feature creates a personalized competitive environment where users can compare their fitness progress exclusively with their approved connections. Unlike global leaderboards that can be overwhelming or demotivating, this feature fosters friendly competition within a user's social circle, providing more meaningful and motivating comparisons.
Users can send and accept friend requests to build their network, then view a customized leaderboard that ranks only those connections across various fitness metrics. The leaderboard will display friends' names and key statistics like steps taken or calories burned. Users can filter the leaderboard by metrics to focus on the aspects of fitness they care about most.
This creates a supportive community experience while leveraging social motivation to encourage consistent app usage and fitness goal achievement.
Tasks:
1. Find a scoreboard that shows the names and current rankings of your friends.
2. Find the workout statistics of one of your friends

Feature 2: AI-Powered Goal Planning
Description:
The AI-Powered Goal Planning feature enables users to set personalized fitness objectives and receive custom-tailored plans to achieve them. Users can specify concrete goals such as burning 1000 calories by week's end, completing 10 workouts in a month, or improving their 5K running time by 2 minutes.
Once a goal is set, the app leverages artificial intelligence to generate a detailed, day-by-day plan that breaks down the necessary activities, durations, and intensity levels needed to reach the target.
The feature includes a clear interface for goal creation, visual representation of the AI-generated plan, progress tracking that updates in real-time as activities are completed. A prominent disclaimer informs users about potential limitations in AI accuracy, while still providing valuable guidance that would otherwise require a personal trainer.
This feature transforms abstract fitness ambitions into concrete, actionable plans, helping users bridge the gap between intention and achievement through personalized AI guidance.
