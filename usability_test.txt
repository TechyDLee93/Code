Tasks: Find a scoreboard that shows the names and current rankings of  your friends

Notes: 
Task 1 (Screen 1): How do you find the leaderboards section?  
What happened: Jeremy was saying that he can “see a Leaderboard button” so he clicks it to get to it. He initially saw that he was currently on the Home page according to the tab above with all the subtabs of the app. Then, he saw the new tab of the Leaderboard and thought he was done with the task.

What confusions were there? Why were they confused? N/A
What could be improved? N/A

Task 2 (Screen 2): Jeremy wants to see the leaderboard for the calories burned.

What confusions were there? Why were they confused? No confusions
What could be improved? “Make the checkboxes look more like boxes that look more like buttons. it isn’t something necessary, it is optional.”

What happened: He clicks on Alice’s name to see her stats and a new page appears showing her stats more in depth, including a graph of her stats.
Feedback:

Hypothesis: It could be a little confusing trying to figure out the function of something if it doesn't look like what it's supposed to be. 
Remedy - Change appearance of buttons

Improvements should include mentioning the advice is AI driven
The start/end date didn't look like buttons 	
	
Hypothesis: Start and end date on paper prototype should be more defined so that user could visible see that it was a sort of hyperlink or  maybe a note should be visible that lets user know.
	Remedy: Changed the "Start date" button to look more like a button and added a note for the user to insert the start date of their plan before they accept the recommendation given by the Goal Planner.




Implemented Fixes:  

Feature 1: Friends-Only Leaderboard

- Changed the appearance of the buttons when selecting the leaderboard that the user wants to see. This improvement was made because Jeremy (tester) indicated that the buttons looked like checkboxes instead of regular buttons, which could mislead the user into thinking that multiple items could be selected.
-.Added a dropdown to select the desired timeframe for the leaderboard data and placements. This improvement was made because Maria (tester) said that the table alone could be interpreted as belonging to any timeframe, and different times can better portray how the users have improved overtime.


Feature 2: Goal Planning

- Added a progress bar when tracking the plan received from the Goal Planner. This progress bar tracks how many tasks have been completed from the tasks given from the Goal Planner for the user to achieve their goal. This improvement was added because María (tester) wanted to know how her progress is going while she keeps track of the calendar.
- Changed the "Start date" button to look more like a button and added a note for the user to insert the start date of their plan before they accept the recommendation given by the Goal Planner. This fix was made because Jeremy (tester) found it difficult to notice that the Start date was a button that has to be pressed before accepting the given plan.
